# What did I use to make this project?

I used React as my frontend framework with Vite for faster builds for dev as well as for production. 
Vite provided me with a minimal React app which allowed me to get started very quickly. I used react-router for routing my pages.

For the backend, I created a microservice using Node.js and Express with DB as MongoDB with middleware for security and for connecting to my MongoDB database. 
I have followed an MVC architecture for my microservice and will deploy my service as a lambda function on AWS ( because the free tier allows 1 million free requests ðŸ˜…).

# For Using Client In Dev.
1. Go to `/client` Install all libraries.
   ```
   npm i
   ```
2. Run the Client on the Dev Server.
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

# For Using Server in Dev.
1. Go to Server `/server` and Install all libraries.
   ```
   npm i
   ```
2. Run the Server on the Dev Server.
   ```
   node index.js
   ```

# Don't wanna waste time in setting up the dev env for usage? Use Docker Compose!
1. Go to the root of the project.
2. You'll see a docker-compose.yml file.
3. Just run this:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```
4. Now if you do not get any errors in your terminal, try out the app by going to `http://localhost:5173/`.
